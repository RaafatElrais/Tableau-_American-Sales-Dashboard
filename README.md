⚡ Tableau – American Sales Dashboard
📘 Project Overview

This Tableau project explores the American Sales Dataset, transforming raw transactional data into a fully interactive business dashboard that delivers instant insight into performance across states, categories, and products.

Built with a clean, executive-style design, this dashboard brings together KPIs, trend analysis, geographic mapping, and product performance — all within a single-page, intuitive layout.

⚠️ Business Challenge

The goal was to give executives and analysts an instant overview of national sales performance.
Key questions driving this analysis included:

Which product categories contribute most to total sales and profit?

What are the monthly sales trends throughout the year?

How are sales distributed across U.S. states?

Which products lead in performance — and which fall behind?

Without a consolidated visual tool, stakeholders were relying on static spreadsheets that made it hard to detect trends and regional differences.

💡 Approach

Imported and cleaned sales data in Tableau Prep / Tableau Desktop.

Built calculated fields for Profit Margin, Average Sales per Customer, and Category Contribution.

Designed interactive visuals:

KPIs: Total Sales, Profit, Number of Customers

Bar Charts: Sales by Category & Product

Line Chart: Sales by Month

Map: Sales by State using color intensity for revenue levels

Added tooltips and filters for dynamic drill-down across time, category, and geography.

Designed a clean, balanced layout using consistent color palettes, spacing, and font hierarchy.

🖼️ Dashboard Overview

The dashboard features:

Top KPIs Section: clear numeric summary of performance (Total Sales, Profit, Customers).

Category View: instantly compares Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies sales.

Time Series Analysis: identifies monthly seasonality and sales peaks.

Geographic Map: reveals regional distribution and high-performing states.

Product Leaderboard: ranks the top-selling products — e.g., Phones, Chairs, and Storage.

📊 Key Metrics
Metric	Value / Insight
Total Sales	$2,261,536.78
Total Profit	316,615
Total Customers	793
Top Category	Technology ($827K)
Next Categories	Furniture ($728K), Office Supplies ($705K)
Top Products	Phones, Chairs, Storage
Top States	California ($446K), New York ($116K), Texas ($79K)
📈 Key Insights

Technology dominates sales and profit, driving over one-third of total revenue.

California and New York are the top-performing states — critical regions for future campaigns.

Phones and Chairs stand out as consistent revenue leaders.

Sales seasonality shows visible peaks in Q4 months, likely driven by end-of-year promotions.

Office Supplies, though high in sales volume, show thinner profit margins — potential optimization area.

⚠️ Problems Identified

Revenue concentration risk — a few top states and products generate most of the income.

High category overlap (Technology vs. Furniture) with inconsistent margins.

Lack of visibility into customer segment profitability (next analysis opportunity).

✅ Recommendations

Expand high-performing regions (e.g., Texas, Florida) with localized campaigns.

Bundle low-margin items (Office Supplies) with premium products to raise average transaction value.

Launch performance dashboards per region to empower local managers.

Automate refresh and publishing to Tableau Public / Tableau Server for real-time insights.

🧰 Tools Used

Tableau Desktop – dashboard creation, calculated fields, actions, and layout design.

Tableau Prep – optional cleaning and transformation.

Excel / CSV Source Data – base dataset for American sales.
