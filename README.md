### ⚡ Tableau – American Sales Dashboard

---

### 📘 Project Overview

This Tableau project explores the American Sales Dataset, transforming raw transactional data into a fully interactive business dashboard that delivers instant insight into performance across states, categories, and products.

Built with a clean, executive-style design, this dashboard brings together KPIs, trend analysis, geographic mapping, and product performance — all within a single-page, intuitive layout.

---

### ⚠️ Business Challenge

The goal was to give executives and analysts an instant overview of national sales performance.
Key questions driving this analysis included:

- Which product categories contribute most to total sales and profit?

- What are the monthly sales trends throughout the year?

- How are sales distributed across U.S. states?

- Which products lead in performance — and which fall behind?

Without a consolidated visual tool, stakeholders were relying on static spreadsheets that made it hard to detect trends and regional differences.

---

### 💡 Approach

- Imported and cleaned sales data in Tableau Prep / Tableau Desktop.

- Built calculated fields for Profit Margin, Average Sales per Customer, and Category Contribution.

- Designed interactive visuals:

1- KPIs: Total Sales, Profit, Number of Customers

2- Bar Charts: Sales by Category & Product

3- Line Chart: Sales by Month

4- Map: Sales by State using color intensity for revenue levels


Designed a clean, balanced layout using consistent color palettes, spacing, and font hierarchy.

### 📊 Key Metrics

- Total Sales	$2,261,536.78
- Total Profit	316,615
- Total Customers	793
- Top Category	Technology ($827K)
- Next Categories	Furniture ($728K), Office Supplies ($705K)

- Top States	California ($446K), New York ($116K), Texas ($79K)

---

### 📈 Key Insights

- Technology dominates sales and profit, driving over one-third of total revenue.

- California and New York are the top-performing states — critical regions for future campaigns.

- Phones and Chairs stand out as consistent revenue leaders.

- Sales seasonality shows visible peaks in Q4 months, likely driven by end-of-year promotions.

- Office Supplies, though high in sales volume, show thinner profit margins — potential optimization area.

---

### ⚠️ Problems Identified

- Revenue concentration risk — a few top states and products generate most of the income.

- High category overlap (Technology vs. Furniture) with inconsistent margins.

- Lack of visibility into customer segment profitability (next analysis opportunity).

---

### ✅ Recommendations

- Expand high-performing regions (e.g., Texas, Florida) with localized campaigns.

- Bundle low-margin items (Office Supplies) with premium products to raise average transaction value.

- Launch performance dashboards per region to empower local managers.

- Automate refresh and publishing to Tableau Public / Tableau Server for real-time insights.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used

- Tableau Public – dashboard creation, calculated fields, actions, and layout design.

- Tableau Prep – optional cleaning and transformation.

- Excel / CSV Source Data – base dataset for American sales.
